class Distribution():
    """
    Define a continuous distribution, with, at minimum methods f(x) and F(x).
    
    A Distribution can be defined in a variety of ways, using subclasses, for 
    example: Scipy, OpenTURNS or custom function. Some distributions may be 
    stored in a library (dictionary?), a summary of which can be printed by 
    the Distribution class via a static method.
