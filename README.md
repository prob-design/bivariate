*Version 2.0*

*Authors: Thirza Feenstra, Jelle Knibbe, Irene van der Veer, Robert Lanzafame, Caspar Jungbacker*

Welcome to version 2.0 of the Bivariate package. This README is very incomplete, as it only provides some installation instructions. An example notebook will follow, where the new functionality will be demonstrated.

## Installation
- Recommended: create a fresh conda environment with at least Python 3.10 and PIP:
  
    ```conda create -n bivariate python=3.10 pip```

- Activate the new environment:
  
  ```conda activate bivariate```

- Clone the repository:
  
  ```git clone https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mude/bivariate_package.git```

- Change directory into the newly created folder. Then, install the package using PIP:
  
  ```pip install .```

If you encounter any issues during installation, please contact me (Caspar), or make a GitLab issue (preferred).
