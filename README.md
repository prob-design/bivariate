*Authors: Thirza Feenstra, Jelle Knibbe, Irene van der Veer, Robert Lanzafame, Caspar Jungbacker*

Welcome to version 2.0 of the Bivariate package. This README is very incomplete, as it only provides some installation instructions. An example notebook will follow, where the new functionality will be demonstrated.

## Installation
- Recommended: create a fresh conda environment with at least Python 3.10 and PIP:
  
    ```conda create -n bivariate python=3.10 pip```

- Activate the new environment:
  
  ```conda activate bivariate```

- Download the package:
  
  ```https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mude/bivariate_package/-/raw/main/dist/bivariate-2.0.0-py3-none-any.whl```

- Then, install the package using PIP:
  
  ```pip install bivariate-2.0.0-py3-none-any.whl```

If you encounter any issues during installation, please contact me (Caspar), or make a GitLab issue (preferred).
